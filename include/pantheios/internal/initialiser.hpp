/** Schwarz Counter initialiser for the Pantheios library
 *
 * In "normal" use, this file is included by pantheios/pantheios.hpp, so
 * that every C++ compilation unit that may potentially be issuing
 * Pantheios calls contains, at file scope (well, actually in an
 * anonymous namespace that is itself at file scoope) an instance of the
 * initialiser. Since the Pantheios core is a reference-counted API
 * (see Chapter 11 of
 * <a href = "http://imperfectcplusplus.com" target="_blank">Imperfect C++</a>),
 * this means that the first C++ compilation linked in initialises the
 * core, and the remainder keep it initialised, until they are all
 * "completed". In other words, just including pantheios/pantheios.hpp
 * causes Pantheios to be initialised.
 *
 * In non-"normal" cases, the inclusion is not made, and the initialisation
 * is not performed. These cases are either when:
 *  - The link-unit being built is a dynamic library (as discriminated by
 *     the presence of the processor symbols <code>_USRDLL</code> or
 *     <code>_AFXDLL</code>, and the preprocessor symbol
 *     <code>PANTHEIOS_FORCE_AUTO_INIT</code> is <b>not</b> defined, or
 *  - The preprocessor symbol <code>PANTHEIOS_NO_AUTO_INIT</code> <b>is</b>
 *     defined.
 *
 * In either of these cases, you <b>must</b> explicitly initialise the
 * Pantheios core (which initialises the front-end and back-end(s))
 * explicitly, using
 * \link pantheios::pantheios_init pantheios_init()\endlink
 * and
 * \link pantheios::pantheios_uninit pantheios_uninit()\endlink.
